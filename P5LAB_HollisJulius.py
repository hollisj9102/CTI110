# P5LAB â€“ Self-Checkout Change Calculator
# This program simulates a self-checkout machine. It generates a random total, 
# asks the user for payment, then calculates and displays the change broken down 
# into dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

    # Convert change to cents for easier calculation
    cents = round(change * 100)

    dollars = cents // 100
    cents = cents % 100

    quarters = cents // 25
    cents = cents % 25

    dimes = cents // 10
    cents = cents % 10

    nickels = cents // 5
    cents = cents % 5

    pennies = cents
